# php-js-example

- Very simple application using PHP as the backend, JS as the frontend, and MySQL as the database.
- The application code is in the app folder.
- There is a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file if you want to use the application with Docker.
  -- All you have to do is run the 'docker-compose up' command within the project's folder to create the appropriate containers.
